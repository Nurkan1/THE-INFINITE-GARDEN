# The Infinite Garden - Professional Edition 🌸✨

**A Procedural Cyber-Zen Ecosystem simulation.**

"The Infinite Garden" is a sandbox experience where technology meets nature. It simulates a digital ecosystem where energy (packets) flows through logic gates, mutating flowers into unique "Tech" or "Alien" species based on the signal properties.

## 🌟 New in v1.1.0 (Bio-Data Inspector)

*   **👁️ Bio-Data Inspector**: Toggle the Inspector to analyze your flowers in real-time.
    *   **Double-click** any Output Node (flower) to view its genetic makeup.
    *   See growth progress, DNA traits (Tech, Alien, Chaos, Hue), symmetry, and spikiness.
    *   Glassmorphism UI with animated scanning effects.
*   **Enhanced UX**: Improved visual feedback and Inspector Mode toggle button.

*   **Universal Connectivity**: Logic gates are no longer restrictive.
    *   **SYNC (AND)**: Acts as a **Tech-Mutagen**. It creates rigid, symmetrical, circuit-like flowers (Cyan/Green).
    *   **ONE (XOR)**: Acts as an **Alien-Mutagen**. It creates organic, tentacled, asymmetrical flowers (Violet/Magenta).
    *   **MERGE (OR)**: Promotes wild, lush growth.
    *   **Hybridization**: Chain different logic gates to create complex hybrids (e.g., Connected Alien Circuits).
*   **Professional UI**: Collapsible HUD for immersive viewing.
*   **Digital Flux**: dynamic cursor trails and living grid background.

## 🎮 Key Features

*   **Procedural Xenobiology:** Every flower is unique, generated via fractal algorithms based on "genetic" data passed through the network.
*   **Living Connections:** Neural links that sway with the wind and pulse with energy.
*   **Visual Choreography (Dance Modes):** Press `Ctrl+B` to switch between:
    *   **Organic:** Natural, bezier vines.
    *   **Tech:** Cyberpunk, rectilinear circuitry.
    *   **Sine:** Oscillating waveforms.
    *   **Chaos:** High-entropy rainbow storms.
*   **Automated Gardener:** Double-click Source nodes to auto-connect to nearby seeds.
*   **Infinite Growth:** No win condition. Just an ever-expanding canvas of digital life.

## 🛠️ Installation (Portable)

1.  Download the latest release (`BitBloom-v1.1.0.AppImage` or `BitBloom-v1.1.0.exe`).
2.  Run the executable. No installation required.
3.  **Note**: A dedicated GPU is recommended for optimal performance due to heavy particle and fluid calculations.

## 💻 Controls

*   **Right Click**: Open Build Menu (Source / Merge / Sync / One / Output).
*   **Left Drag**: Connect Nodes.
*   **Shift + Drag**: Move node clusters (Group Drag).
*   **Ctrl + B**: Cycle Visual Styles.
*   **Double-Click Source**: Auto-Connect.
*   **👁️ Inspector**: Toggle Bio-Data Inspector.
    *   **Double-Click Flowers**: Analyze DNA and growth data.

## 🔧 Development

This project is built with:
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core simulation engine.
*   **HTML5 Canvas**: Rendering system.
*   **Electron**: Desktop encapsulation.
*   **Vite**: Tooling.

### Build Setup

```bash
