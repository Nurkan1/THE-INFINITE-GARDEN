# v1.0.4: Platform Credits & Final Polish 🌸✨

"The Infinite Garden" evolves into a truly universal ecosystem. This update unlocks the full potential of the logic gates, turning them into genetic modifiers that mutate the flora into "Tech" or "Alien" species.

## 🌟 New Features (Universal Update)
*   **Universal Neural Network**: Logic gates are no longer restrictive. They now accept single inputs and mix genetic traits.
*   **Genetic Mutation System**:
    *   **SYNC (AND) -> Tech Mutation 🦾**: Infuses energy with Order and Symmetry. Flowers become rigid, circuit-like, and glow in Cyan/Electric Green.
    *   **ONE (XOR) -> Alien Mutation 👽**: Infuses energy with Chaos. Flowers become organic, tentacled, asymmetrical, and pulse in Ultraviolet/Magenta.
*   **Professional UI**: New collapsible HUD (Pin/Unpin) for immersive viewing.
*   **Credits**: Updated in-game help to credit **Nurcan Kerim** (Fullstack Developer & Visionary).

## ✨ Core Features (Polished)
*   **Connection Choreography (Dance Mode)**: Press `Ctrl + B` to cycle visuals:
    *   🌿 **Organic**: Natural, swaying bezier vines.
    *   🦾 **Tech**: Strict, rectilinear cyberpunk circuitry.
    *   🌊 **Sine**: Oscillating data waves.
    *   🌈 **Chaos**: High-entropy, rainbow-infused energy storms.
*   **Visual Layering Fix**: Connection lines now render behind flowers for depth.
*   **Hydro-Data Splash**: Energy packets create nourishing water particle splashes on impact.
*   **Automated Gardener**: Double-click Source Nodes to auto-connect to nearby seeds.
*   **Group Drag**: Hold `Shift + Drag` to move entire clusters.
