# The Infinite Garden 🌸

**A Procedural Cyber-Zen Ecosystem simulation.**

"The Infinite Garden" is a sandbox experience where technology meets nature. There is no end, only growth. Nurture a digital ecosystem that evolves, blooms, and spreads across the screen, powered by cellular automata and procedural generation.

## 🎮 Key Features

*   **Cyber-Nature Fusion:** Cultivate "Output Nodes" (Flowers) that inherit DNA and traits from purely logical signal inputs.
*   **Procedural Xenobiology:** Every flower is unique, generated via fractal algorithms based on "genetic" data passed through the network.
*   **Living Connections:** Neural links that sway with the wind and pulse with energy.
*   **Visual Choreography (Dance Modes):** Press `Ctrl+B` to switch between:
    *   **Organic:** Natural, bezier vines.
    *   **Tech:** Cyberpunk, rectilinear circuitry.
    *   **Sine:** Oscillating waveforms.
    *   **Chaos:** High-entropy rainbow storms.
*   **Automated Gardener:** Double-click Source nodes to auto-connect to nearby seeds.
*   **Infinite Growth:** No win condition. Just an ever-expanding canvas of digital life.

## 🛠️ Installation (Portable)

1.  Download the latest release (`The Infinite Garden 1.0.2.exe`).
2.  Run the executable. No installation required.
3.  **Note**: A dedicated GPU is recommended for optimal performance due to heavy particle and fluid calculations.

## 💻 Controls

*   **Right Click**: Open Build Menu (Source / Merge / Sync / One / Output).
*   **Left Drag**: Connect Nodes.
*   **Shift + Drag**: Move node clusters (Group Drag).
*   **Ctrl + B**: Cycle Visual Styles.
*   **Double-Click Source**: Auto-Connect.

## 🔧 Development

This project is built with:
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core simulation engine.
*   **HTML5 Canvas**: Rendering system.
*   **Electron**: Desktop encapsulation.
*   **Vite**: Tooling.
